Intro
	Res: The USFG should reform it's Environmental Policies, particularly those concerning honeybees.

Harm1: Bees Dying
	The number of managed colonies in the United States for honey production has been in decline since the 1940s. In 1998, there were 5 million hives in america. As of 2015, there were 2.5 million. In 2013, the EU banned all neonicotinoids, and the US should not fall behind on public health, and endanger its own citizens.

	Impact: Agriculture

Plan: The USFG should ban all neonics
	Enforcement: EPA/USDA
	Timeline: Next growing season
	Funding: Not necessary

Solvency: Banning eliminates use

Advantage: Neuronicotinoids are a danger to public health. In the article "EFSA assesses potential link between two neonicotinoids and developmental neurotoxicity" http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131217, the EFSA says quote: "The PPR Panel found that acetamiprid  and imidacloprid {both neonicitinoids} may adversely affect the development of neurons and brain structures {in humans} associated with functions such as learning and memory. It concluded that some current guidance levels for acceptable exposure to acetamiprid and imidacloprid may not be protective enough to safeguard against developmental neurotoxicity and should be reduced."
	
Advantage: Gets into drinking water
	A study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that QUOTE "neonics are widespread contaminants of surface and ground water that could be a source of drinking water... Limited testing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found neonics in fruits and vegetables, where the pesticide’s systemic nature means it cannot be washed off the surface of these foods." UNQUOTE
	
Unq: Bees Dead. “Neonicotinoids are not the only problem that bees face,” Dave Goulson, a biologist at the University of Sussex said. “But certainly... studies suggest very strongly that exposure to these pesticides is one of the factors causing bees to decline.”
