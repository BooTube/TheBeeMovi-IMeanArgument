Intro
	Res: The USFG should reform it's Environmental Policies, particularly those concerning honeybees.
	In 2013, the EU banned all neonicotinoids, and the US should not fall behind on public health, and endanger its own citizens.
	

Harm1: Bee Populations Steadily Declining
	The number of managed colonies in the United States for honey production has been in decline since the 1940s. In 1998, there were 5 million hives in america. As of 2015, there were 2.5 million.

Plan: The USFG should ban all neonics
	Enforcement: EPA/USDA
	Timeline: Next growing season
	Funding: Not necessary

Solvency: Banning eliminates use

Advantage: Dangerous to Human Mental Health
	Neuronicotinoids are a danger to public health. In the article "EFSA assesses potential link between two neonicotinoids and developmental neurotoxicity" http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131217, the EFSA says quote: "The PPR Panel found that acetamiprid  and imidacloprid {both neonicitinoids} may affect the development of neurons and brain structures {in humans} associated with functions such as learning and memory. It {is} concluded that some current levels for acceptable exposure to acetamiprid and imidacloprid may not be protective enough to safeguard against developmental neurotoxicity and should be reduced." From the NRDC (natural resource defense council) QUOTE "The pesticides are designed to target the insect nervous system – this is how they are effective insecticides... [It causes] havoc with the affected nerve cell and ultimately killing a target insect within hours or days." Unquote. It can also damage parts of the brain involving fetal growth, muscle contraction, learning, and the ability to pay attention.

Advantage: Permeates Ecosystems and uses Drinking Water as a Vector
	A study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that QUOTE "neonics are widespread contaminants of surface and ground water that could be a source of drinking water... Limited testing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found neonics in fruits and vegetables, where the pesticide’s systemic nature means it cannot be washed off the surface of these foods."

Rebuttals!!

Arg: Neonics are not dangerous
Rebutt: See advantage 1.

Arg: Bee population stable for years
Rebutt: Sure, that may be true, but if we keep using these pesticides, those numbers could plummet to an all-time low. We want to prevent this disaster from happening, not by having it happen! Thus we should ban neonics before the bees all die.

Arg: If neonics are banned, people will switch to more deadly pesticides
Rebutt: First off, neonics are considered just a cheap insurance for expensive seeds. If they’re cheap, farmers might just be better off without them. (see next argument rebuttal)

Arg: Farmers can’t live without neonics
Rebutt: Now, this piece of evidence from the USEPA (united states environmental protection agency) says, QUOTE (in March 2015)
“This analysis provides evidence that U.S. soybean growers derive limited to no benefit from neonicotinoid seed treatments in most instances.  Published data indicate that most usage of neonicotinoid seed treatments does not protect soybean yield any better than doing no pest control. Given that much of the reported seed treatment usage in the U.S. on soybeans is not associated with a target pest, BEAD [the Biological and Economic Analysis Division] concludes that much of the observed use is preventative and may not be currently providing any actual pest management benefits.”
This evidence clearly says that neonics are quite useless against pests, but have a large impact on bees, humans, and even birds.

Arg: 31% environmental budget cut
Rebutt: The USDA, in 2014, provided 8 million US dollars just to help boost the declining bee population. If the government is willing to give that much just to encourage bees, imagine how much could be achieved if the government realizes that these pesticides are seeping into our drinking water, wreaking havoc on the human body’s nervous system.
