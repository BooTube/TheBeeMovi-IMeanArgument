Harm2: Gets into drinking water
	A study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that QUOTE "neonics are widespread contaminants of surface and ground water that could be a source of drinking water... Limited testing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found neonics in fruits and vegetables, where the pesticideâ€™s systemic nature means it cannot be washed off the surface of these foods." UNQUOTE
	
Plan: Ban neonics again! (see previous plan)

Solvency: Banning eliminates use :D

Unq: People getting brain/internal damage?? (need evidence)
